                        <p>Annual global production of plastics has increased more than 200-fold since 1950.</p>
                        <p>In 2015 the world produced more than 380 million tonnes of plastic.</p>

                        <p>This figure also highlights an important point about recycling.

                        <p>Whilst recycling is preferable to incineration or landfill by displacing new plastic production, most plastic <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/faq-on-plastics#how-many-times-can-plastic-be-recycled">can be recycled only once or twice</a>.</p>
                        <p>This means that most recycled plastic eventually ends up in landfill or incineration.</p>
                        <p>"Recycling delays, rather than avoids, final disposal"<br>(Geyer et al. 2017)</p>

                        <p>Packaging is the dominant form of waste because it:
                            <li>is the sector which <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/plastic-production-by-sector">uses the most plastic</a>

                        <p>Plastic waste can arise from land (via coastlines and rivers) and from marine sources (such as fishing nets, ropes, lines and abandoned vessels).</p>

                        <p>Best estimates suggest:
                        <li><strong>20-30% of ocean plastics come from marine sources</strong>
                        <li><strong>70-80% from land</strong></p>
                        <p>However, in certain locations, marine sources can be more significant. The <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution#the-great-pacific-garbage-patch-gpgp">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> has more than half (52%) from marine sources due to intensive fishing activity in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

                        <p>But to understand the largest contributors to plastic pollution, we must correct for:</p>

                        <li>how much of this plastic is 'mismanaged'</li>
                        <p><p>Mismanaged plastic waste is waste which is inadequately managed (seen in the chart opposite), plus littered waste (seen <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/plastic-waste-littered">here</a>).</p>
                        <p>High-income countries tend to have effective waste management systems and therefore low levels of inadequately managed waste.</p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>Once we correct for these factors we can understand the geographical distribution of plastic waste at high risk of entering the ocean.</p>
                        <p>Each country's share of global mismanaged coastal waste is shown in the chart opposite.
                        <p>Here we see very strong regional dominance particularly across Asia.</p>
                        <p>China, for example, accounts for 28% of mismanaged plastic waste.</p>

                        <p>Historically, China (sometimes via Hong Kong) has been the largest plastic importer. China and Hong Kong have imported 72.4 percent of global traded plastic waste. <p>In the years prior to 2016, around 10% of China's total plastic waste was from imports.</p>
                        <p>However, at the end of 2017 China imposed a complete ban on the imports of non-industrial plastic waste.</p>

                <p><p>Most of our current approaches to tackling the problem of global plastic pollution focus on very small-impact solutions (e.g plastic straw bans).
                <p>These approaches, whilst well-intentioned, will be quickly absorbed by the growth of global plastics production.
                <p>We must focus on the high-impact solutions. Understanding the global picture of plastic pollution helps us to do this.
