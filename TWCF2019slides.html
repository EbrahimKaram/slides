If you ask people the question <i>"Over the next 15 years, do you think living conditions for people around the world will get better or worse?"</i> the majority expects stagnation or worsening.</br></br>

So the evidence suggests that income and life satisfaction tend to go together (which still doesn’t mean they are one and the same).

                </br>Our World in Data is an online publication that supplies research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems. Our work is all public and free; and our visitors range from students and school children doing their classwork, to journalists, teachers, researchers and policymakers, looking for the data and research to inform their work.
            	</br></br> Our World in Data is a collaborative effort between researchers at the University of Oxford, who are the scientific editors of the website content; and the non-profit organization Global Change Data Lab, who publishes and maintains the website and the data tools.
