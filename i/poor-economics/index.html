                        <p>According to the International Poverty Line, people are considered to be in 'extreme poverty' if they live on less than $1.90 per day, or the equivalent amount after converting currencies and adjusting for price differences between countries. This is the definition used by the World Bank and many other international institutions.</p>
                        <p>As this chart shows, about 700 million people in the world live below this low threshold. And about 4.7 billion people (more than half of the global population) live below 10 dollars per day.</p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p>As we can see, in 1820 there were just under 1.1 billion people in the world, of which more than 1 billion lived in extreme poverty. Over the next 150 years, the decline of poverty was not fast enough to offset the very rapid rise of the world population, so the number of non-poor and poor people increased. Since around 1970, however, we are living in a world in which the number of non-poor people is rising, while the number of poor people is falling. </p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p> In fact, extreme poverty was very common in today's rich countries until fairly recently. Actually, in most of these countries the majority of the population lived in extreme deprivation only a few generations ago. Progress was made at a fast pace — in some cases even at a <em>constant</em> pace. </p>

                        <p>And this progress is not only about incomes moving marginally above the extreme poverty line. In recent decades the global poverty rate has been going down independently of whether we set the poverty line at 1.90 or 10 dollars per day.</p>

                        <p> The Gallup World Poll asked people around the world what they thought about their standard of living—not only about their income. The following chart compares the answers of people in different countries with the average income in those countries. It shows that, broadly speaking, people living in poorer countries tend to be less satisfied with their living standards.</p>

                    <figcaption>
                        <p> And there is a similar trend in terms of subjective well-being. As this chart shows, low-income countries tend to have lower self-reported life satisfaction; and richer people within these countries tend to have higher self-reported life satisfaction. </p>

                        <blockquote>“Economists (and other experts) seem to have very little useful to say about why some countries grow and others do not...Given that economic growth requires manpower and brainpower, it seems plausible, however, that whenever that spark occurs, it is more likely to catch fire if women and men are properly educated, well fed, and healthy, and if citizens feel secure and confident enough to invest in their children, and to let them leave home to get the new jobs in the city. It is also probably true that until that happens, something needs to be done to make that wait for the spark more bearable.”</blockquote>
