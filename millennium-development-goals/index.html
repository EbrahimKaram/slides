                        Target 7.C was to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation.
                        <p><p>In 1990, 46% of the world population didn't have access to improved sanitation.</p>
                        <p><p>By 2015, this fell to 32% without access.</p>
                         <p><p>This target (a reduction to 23%) was therefore not achieved.</p>
